# Cats-dogs_classifier

I am going to show you how to classify images with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)


Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
CNNs are deep learning models suited for analyzing visual imagery. 
They are heavily influenced by how we - humans, see the surrounding world. 
Before we proceed to CNNs in order to analyze how computers see, letâ€™s focus on how humans are able to do it.

Image Classification - is it a cat or a dog?
The ultimate goal of this project is to create a system that can detect cats and dogs. 
While our goal is very specific (cats vs dogs), ImageClassifier can detect anything that is tangible with an adequate dataset.

Dataset: Dogs vs Cats
Description: Binary classification. Classify dogs and cats.
Number_of_Classes:2
Training: 8000 images (4000 per class)
Testing: 4000 images (2000 per class)
